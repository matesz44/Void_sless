If stdin is longer than
.IR translation-stream ,
the remainder of stdin is printed with the last translation
or no translation if
.I translation-stream
does not contain any translations. If stdin is shorter than
.IR translation-stream ,
the remainder of
.I translation-stream
is ignored but may be partially read.
