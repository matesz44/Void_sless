.SH NAME
blind-matrix-reflect - Create an affine 2D-transformation matrix for reflection about a line
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blind-matrix-reflect
[-c]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blind-matrix-reflect
creates an affine 2D-transformation matrix for
reflection about a line. The parameters for the
matrix is read in stdin in format of a blind video,
one matrix per frame in stdin created and printed
to stdout in format of a blind video.
.P
Each frame in stdin shall contain exactly 2 pixels,
the first pixel holds the x-value of the line going
out from origo the image is reflected around, the
second pixel holds the y-value of this line.
.P
The luma (encoding in the Y-channel, the second
channel) multiplied by the alpha (the fourth channel)
of the input pixels are used as the values. Each
values in the resulting matrices are stored
in all channels.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c
Create different matrices for each channel. Use
values from each channel in stdin to create
matrices whose values are stored in the same
channels in stdout.
