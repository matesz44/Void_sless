.SH NAME
blind-matrix-translate - Create an affine 2D-transformation matrix for translation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blind-matrix-translate
[-c]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blind-matrix-translate
creates an affine 2D-transformation matrix for
translation. The parameters for the matrix is read
in stdin in format of a blind video, one matrix
per frame in stdin created and printed to stdout
in format of a blind video.
.P
Each frame in stdin shall contain exactly 2 pixel,
the first pixel holds the number of pixels the
image shall be translated rightwards, and the
second pixel holds the number of pixels the
image shall be translated downwards.
.P
The luma (encoding in the Y-channel, the second
channel) multiplied by the alpha (the fourth channel)
of the input pixels are used as the values. Each
values in the resulting matrices are stored
in all channels.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c
Create different matrices for each channel. Use
values from each channel in stdin to create
matrices whose values are stored in the same
channels in stdout.
.SH NOTES
The image upwards rather than downwards if the
Y-axis grows upwards rather than downwards.
