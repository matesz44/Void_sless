.SH NAME
blind-to-named - Send a file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blind-to-named
[-a]
.I path
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blind-to-named
create a
.BR unix (7)
socket with the filename
.I path
and sends the stdin file descriptor to the
first process that connects to it.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -a
Rather than binding to a filename, create and abstract
address, starting with a NUL byte followed by
.I path
and padded with NUL bytes until the end of the address.
.SH RATIONALE
The pipeline construction, in even advanced, shells
are not flexible enough to do all kinds of pipelinings
that are necessary when doing complicated effects with
.BR blind (7).
For example, this is necessary to pipe video into
two processes pipelines using
.BR tee (1)
and then using the end of both pipelines as the in
input to the process, like inverse multiplexing.
