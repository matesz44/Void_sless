.SH NAME
blind-from-named - Receive a file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blind-from-named
[-t
.IR decisecs ]
[-a]
([-f
.IR fd ]
.I path
.RI [ command \ ...]
|
.IR path )
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blind-from-named
connects to a
.BR unix (7)
socket with the filename
.I path
and received a file descriptor.
.P
If a
.I command
is specified, the received file descriptor set to
stdin, and the process executes to the specified
.IR commmand ,
otherwise, the input from the received file descriptor
is sent to stdout.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -a
Rather than binding to a filename, create and abstract
address, starting with a NUL byte followed by
.I path
and padded with NUL bytes until the end of the address.
.TP
.BR -f \ \fIfd\fP
Assign the file descriptor number
.I fd
to the received file descriptor, rather than as
stdin.
.TP
.BR -t \ \fIdecisecs\fP
Try to connect to the socket for at most
.I decisecs
deciseconds, trying once per decisecond. (Default is 10.)
.SH RATIONALE
The pipeline construction, in even advanced, shells
are not flexible enough to do all kinds of pipelinings
that are necessary when doing complicated effects with
.BR blind (7).
For example, this is necessary to pipe video into
two processes pipelines using
.BR tee (1)
and then using the end of both pipelines as the in
input to the process, like inverse multiplexing.
