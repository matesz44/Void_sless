of the input videos in the new room, such that the
right-most part of the video has is put side-by-side
with the left-most part of the video, and analogously
for the other sides.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
.B blind-extend
requires enough free memory to load two full frames into
memory, one of the size of the source video's frames,
and one of the size of the target video's frames. A frame
requires 32 bytes per pixel it contains.
.B blind-extend
has not been optimised for memory usage, but instead
for code simplicity.
