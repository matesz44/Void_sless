.B blind-time-blur
reads a video from stdin and a mask video from
.IR alpha-stream .
The first frame from the video is printed to stdout
as is, and the first frame from the mask video is
ignored. Succeeding frames are drawn on top of the
last frame printed to stdout, with its alpha cannel
multiplied pixel-by-pixel by the product of the
luminosity and the alpha from corresponding pixel
in the mask video, and then printed stdout.
.P
If stdin is longer than
.IR alpha-stream ,
the remainder of stdin is printed without any changes.
If stdin is shorter than
.IR alpha-stream ,
the remainder of
.I alpha-stream
is ignored but may be partially read.
