.SH NAME
blind-to-portable - Convert a video to a portable format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blind-to-portable
[-s]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blind-to-portable
converts a processable video into a portable format, so
it can be sent to a computer with a different endianness
or floating-point number encoding, and processes only
multiple machines.
.SH OPTIONS
.B -s
Do not convert single-precision floating-points number
to binary32, and double-precision floating-points number
to binary64.
.SH NOTES
The endian is changed to little endian.
.SH RATIONALE
Most computers use binary32 and binary64 for
single-precision and double-precision floating-points
number, respectively, however, this is not always the
case for microcontrollers designed for embedded systems.
