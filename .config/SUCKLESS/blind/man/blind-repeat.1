.SH NAME
blind-repeat - Repeat a video
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blind-repeat
([-f]
.I count
|
.RB ' inf ')
.RI [ file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blind-repeat
write the a video to stdout that is a loop of the
selected video. The looped video is read from the
selected
.IR file .
The video will be repeated
.I count
times, or until there is no process the reads from
this process's stdout if
.B inf
is selected instead of
.IR count .
.P
.I file
must be a regular file, or
.RB ' - '.
If
.I file
is
.RB ' - ',
.B blind-repeat
will read stdin into memory; you are highly discouraged
from using this unless stdin is a single frame, or known
to only be a very small number of frames, is it can
potentially use all of the computer's memory.
.P
If
.I file
is omitted,
.RB ' - '
is used.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -f
Repeat each frames
.B count
times before copying the next frame, rather than
copying the entire video
.B count
times.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
.B blind-repeat
requires enough free memory to load the entire video
into memory if it is read from stdin. A frame requires
32 bytes per pixel it contains. So for a 720p video at
25 Hz, 1 GB is reached in just below 1.5 seconds.
However, if
.B -f
is used, only a full video frame will be loaded into
memory rather than an entire video, if reading from stdin.
