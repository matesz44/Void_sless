.SH DESCRIPTION

will use the values specified in

the number of frames will be calculated from

pixel format.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h
Used if the video file does not have a head.
This of course means that
.RB ' same '
cannot be used as there is not way to know
the geometry or format of the video if it does
not have a head.
.SH RETIONALE
.B blind-rewrite-head
only support regular files because combining
.BR blind-read-head (1),
.BR blind-write-head (1),
and
.BR cat (1)
is sufficient for doing the same operation on pipes,
but not on regular files that are too large to store
two copies of on disc.
