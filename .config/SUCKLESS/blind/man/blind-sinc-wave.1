.TH BLIND-SINC-WAVE 1 blind
.SH NAME
blind-sinc-wave - Apply cardinal sine-wave repetition to gradient
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blind-sinc-wave
[-e]
.RI [ theta0-stream ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blind-sinc-wave
reads a video from stdin, applies a filter to
each channel to it, and prints the result to
stdout. The filter is designed for applying
repetition to a gradient, and thus assumes the
range of visible values is [0, 1]. The applied
filter creates a cardinal sine-wave.
.P
If
.I theta0-stream
is specified, it must be a video with only
one pixel per frame. When applying the sine
function, it is applied to the sum of the
pixel it is applied to and the pixel in
the same frame in
.IR theta0-stream .
.SH NOTES
.BR blind-arithm (1)
with the
.B mul
and
.B div
operators can be used to stretch the wave.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -e
Apply optimisation that assumes all channels
are identical. If
.I theta0-stream
is specified, the values from its second channel
(the Y channel) are used for all channels.
