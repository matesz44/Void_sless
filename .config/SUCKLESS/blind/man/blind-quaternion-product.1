.TH BLIND-QUATERNION-PRODUCT 1 blind
.SH NAME
blind-quaternion-product - Calculate the quaternion product of colours in a video
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blind-quaternion-product
.I right-hand-stream
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blind-quaternion-product
reads left-hand operands from stdin, and right-hand
operands from
.IR right-hand-stream ,
and calculates the quaternion product of the colours.
The values in the the first channel (the X channel) are
treated as real, the values in the the second channel
(the Y channel) are treated as i-imaginary, the values
in the the third channel (the Z channel) are treated
as j-imaginary, and the values in the the fourth channel
(the alpha channel) are treated as k-imaginary.
.P
If stdin is longer than
.IR right-hand-stream ,
the remainder of stdin is printed without any changes.
If stdin is shorter than
.IR right-hand-stream ,
the remainder of
.I right-hand-stream
is ignored but may be partially read.
