.TH BLIND-MATRIX-TRANSPOSE 1 blind
.SH NAME
blind-matrix-transpose - Create an affine 2D-transformation matrix for transposition
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blind-matrix-transpose
[-c]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blind-matrix-transpose
creates an affine 2D-transformation matrix for
transposition. The parameters for the matrix is read
in stdin in format of a blind video, one matrix
per frame in stdin created and printed to stdout
in format of a blind video.
.P
Each frame in stdin shall contain exactly 1 pixel,
this pixel holds degree of the transposition, 0
meaning no transposition at all, 1 meaning full
transposition.
.P
The luma (encoding in the Y-channel, the second
channel) multiplied by the alpha (the fourth channel)
of the input pixels are used as the values. Each
values in the resulting matrices are stored
in all channels.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c
Create different matrices for each channel. Use
values from each channel in stdin to create
matrices whose values are stored in the same
channels in stdout.
