.SH NAME
blind-peek-head - Peeks the head from a video
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blind-peek-head
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blind-peek-head
peeks the head a video from stdin, and
prints it, without the magic number, to stdout.
The output will contain: the number of frames,
<space>, the width, <space>, the height, <space>,
and the pixel format. The output is text, and
thus ends with a <newline>. The state of stdin
will remain unchanged.
.SH NOTES
.B blind-peek-head
requires that stdin is a socket, a regular file,
or a (on Linux only) a pipe. Direct pipes and
datagram sockets are supported but require that
the entire head must be written in one write.
