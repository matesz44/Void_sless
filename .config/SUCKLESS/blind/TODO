blind-tee (and tee(1)) is too slow (bottleneck) and must be reimplemented
using tee(2) and splice(2). cat(1) may also be too slow, if this is the
case, add blind-splice that just copies stdin to stdout using splice(2).

blind-transform		affine transformation by matrix multiplication, -[xy] for tiling, -s for
				improve quality on downscaling (pixels' neighbours must not change)
blind-apply-map		remap pixels (distortion) using the X and Y values, -[xy] for tiling, -s for
				improve quality on downscaling (pixels' neighbours must not change)
blind-find-frame	a graphical tool for locating frames, should highlight key frames, and
				play audio. Should support both regular videos files and uivf
				finding key frames: ffprobe -show_frames (lists all frames)
blind-invert-chroma	invert the chroma
blind-from-sent		convert a sent presentation to a one-frame-per-slide blind video

blind-apply-icc		apply ICC profile to video
blind-convex-gradient	create a gradient in the shape of a convex lens
blind-concave-gradient	create a gradient in the shape of a concave lens
			(convexo-concave gradient is not necessary is blind-convex-gradient
			 or blind-concave-gradient can be combined with blind-arithm for this)
blind-preview		a graphical tool for previewing the output of a pipeline
				should display the output for a selected frame or image
				should have sliders to tune environment variables
---			tool from creating blockwise transitions

Add [-j jobs] to blind-from-video, blind-to-video, blind-convert, and blind-apply-kernel.

long double is slightly faster than long.
long double (xyza q) could be added as another format.
unsigned char (xyza 8) could be added as another format, it's probably good for previewing

blind-{convert,{from,to}-video} add options to cache result of:
-	last pixel
-	same pixel in previous frame

REGRESSIONS:
	blind-gauss-blur		transparency pixels become dark green

HELP REQUIRED:
	blind-z-map			create a Z-map video from two or more videos
	blind-track			track the movement of a point
	blind-transition-mosaic		gradually turn a mosaic pattern into another
